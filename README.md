# pynqz2
Using Pynq Z2 board for FW / SW development

Start by download the standard OS for Pynq Z2. This is is currently version is 3.0.1, which is Ubuntu 22.04 based.
Download it from [The Pynq support site](https://www.pynq.io/boards.html) or directly [here](https://bit.ly/pynqz2_v3_0_1). This will give you a ZIP file, with an image (pynq_z2_v3.0.1.img) inside.
Flash this image to an SD card (min 8 Gb).

Steps:
- Insert the SD card
- Check that the jumper on the right is set to SD, not QSPI or JTAG
- Connect the USB cable
- Connect the power cable
- Connect the network cable (it can be connected anywhere on your network, it will automatically request a IP address)
- Switch on the board
- Locate the serial device on your PC and assign it to a terminal (e.g. Teraterm)

The board will boot, and show the following boot output:

PYNQ uses a base.bit bitfile, which is located under /home/xilinx/pynq/overlays/base (actually) the pynq folder is a symlink to /usr/local/share/pynq-venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pynq.

Creating a base bitstream for the PYNQ-Z2 board involves generating a hardware design using Xilinx Vivado and exporting it for use with the PYNQ framework. Below is a concise guide to help you through the process:

Steps to Create a Base Bitstream for PYNQ-Z2

Install Required Tools:

Install Xilinx Vivado (version compatible with PYNQ-Z2, e.g., 2020.2 or 2021.1).
Ensure you have the PYNQ repository cloned from GitHub.

Clone the PYNQ Repository:

Clone the official PYNQ GitHub repository:
Copy the code
git clone https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ.git
cd PYNQ/boards/Pynq-Z2/base


Set Up Vivado Project:

Open Vivado and create a new project.
Select the PYNQ-Z2 board as the target hardware.
Import the necessary IP cores and constraints files from the base folder in the PYNQ repository.

Add Design Sources:

Add the provided TCL scripts and block design files from the PYNQ repository.
Run the TCL script to generate the block design:
Copy the code
source base.tcl


Generate the Bitstream:

Validate the design in Vivado.
Synthesize and implement the design.
Generate the bitstream file (base.bit).

Export Hardware:

Export the hardware design along with the bitstream:
Copy the code
File > Export > Export Hardware

Include the .hwh file for PYNQ compatibility.

Copy Files to PYNQ-Z2:

Transfer the generated base.bit and base.hwh files to the PYNQ-Z2 board (e.g., via SCP or USB).
Place them in the /home/xilinx/pynq/overlays/base/ directory.

Test the Bitstream:

On the PYNQ-Z2 board, load the bitstream using Python:
Copy the code
from pynq import Overlay
base = Overlay("/home/xilinx/pynq/overlays/base/base.bit")
base.download()

Tips:
Ensure all IP cores are compatible with the Vivado version you're using.
Use the PYNQ-Z2 board files provided in the PYNQ repository for accurate constraints.
If errors occur, check the Vivado logs for missing dependencies or incorrect configurations.

This process will create a functional base bitstream for the PYNQ-Z2 board, enabling you to use it with the PYNQ framework for further development.
